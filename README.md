## Metis Introduction to Data Science - Final Project

The dataset that will be used for this project is titled `beer_reviews.csv` and originates from https://data.world/socialmediadata/beeradvocate

This dataset consists of `1,586,614` observations and has `13` columns as follows:
* `brewery_id`            int64
* `brewery_name`          object
* `review_time`           int64
* `review_overall`        float64
* `review_aroma`          float64
* `review_appearance`     float64
* `review_profilename`    object
* `beer_style`            object
* `review_palate`         float64
* `review_taste`          float64
* `beer_name`             object
* `beer_abv`              float64
* `beer_beerid`           int64

## Some questions to be asked of this dataset
* 1- Is there a steady relationship between appearance, aroma, taste across different beer styles - can an overall rating be predicted based on training data from a given beer style against a different distinct beer style
* 2- How biased are raters to begin with e.g.  if a given rater has provided consistently high marks for a given beer style, how does this compare with different beer styles they have reviewed
* 3- Given the different machine learning techniques learned in class, how do these behave on this particular dataset (use what is being taught to learn more about the relationship of this dataset)

This project will be split across multiple notebooks as follows

* `1- Step 1 - Explore the Data:` this notebook introduces the intial data set in its entirety and starts exploring certain relationships. It further conducts some descriptive analytics in order to better guage opportunities for enhanced data analysis.
*  `more to be added as the project evolves`
